  <p><strong>Get to know me</strong></p>
  <p>I'm currently a student undertaking a major in Biomedical sciences,living in Nairobi,Kenya.The reason as to why i decided to take part in this program was inorder for me to gain the neccesaary skills to manage
    consolidating both fields that i'm interested in.My hope is to manage to develope working apps and websites that would ease day to day experiences of both patients and medical personel in
    not only hospitals but also at the comfort of their houses.</p>
